## Current Status / Progress Tracking

Completed the database schema updates for the Project ID system. The schema includes:
1. Organizations table with subscription management
2. Projects table with environment and KYC provider settings
3. Project settings table for configuration
4. Project API keys table for authentication
5. Project usage stats table for monitoring
6. Added project_id to all existing tables

Created the core services:
1. OrganizationService for managing organizations and members
2. ProjectService for managing projects and settings
3. ApiKeyService for managing project API keys

Created supporting components:
1. TypeScript types and interfaces
2. Zod schemas for validation
3. Slug generation utility
4. Project authentication middleware
5. API routes for all CRUD operations

Next steps:
1. Add tests for all services and routes
2. Add API documentation
3. Implement request validation middleware
4. Add rate limiting per project
5. Add audit logging for all operations

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Ready to proceed with testing the Project ID system implementation. Would you like me to:
1. Create test suites for the services
2. Add API documentation
3. Implement the multi-tenant middleware
4. Or focus on a different aspect?

## Lessons

1. Always implement proper error handling and logging
2. Include comprehensive monitoring from the start
3. Test each component in isolation before integration
4. Document API changes and migration procedures
5. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
6. Use database transactions for related operations
7. Add proper indices for performance
8. Use enum types for better data integrity
