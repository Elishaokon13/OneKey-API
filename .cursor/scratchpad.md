# OneKey KYC API Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The human user requested to build an API for OneKey KYC system - a privacy-preserving identity verification system. After reviewing the comprehensive architecture document, this project has evolved from a simple API to a sophisticated blockchain-integrated KYC attestation system featuring:

- **Multi-provider KYC Integration**: Smile Identity, Onfido, Trulioo
- **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)**: For creating verifiable attestations
- **Privy Authentication**: For secure user authentication
- **Decentralized Storage**: Filecoin/Arweave for encrypted data storage
- **Lit Protocol**: For fine-grained access control
- **Zero-knowledge Proofs**: For selective disclosure of identity attributes
- **Client-side Encryption**: Ensuring no PII is stored on servers

This is a complex system that requires careful implementation across multiple phases, from basic API setup to advanced cryptographic features.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Complexity
- **Blockchain Integration**: EAS attestation creation and verification
- **Multi-provider Coordination**: Handling different KYC provider APIs and response formats
- **Privacy Architecture**: Ensuring zero PII storage while maintaining functionality
- **Decentralized Storage**: Managing encrypted data across Filecoin/Arweave
- **Access Control**: Implementing Lit Protocol for fine-grained permissions

### Security Considerations
- **Zero PII Storage**: All personally identifiable information must be encrypted client-side
- **Attestation Integrity**: Ensuring tamper-proof identity verifications
- **Key Management**: Secure handling of encryption keys and wallet connections
- **Cross-platform Verification**: Enabling KYC reuse across different platforms

### Integration Points
- **KYC Providers**: Real-time API integration with multiple verification services
- **Blockchain Networks**: EAS integration on Base/Ethereum networks
- **Storage Networks**: Filecoin and Arweave for persistent encrypted storage
- **Authentication**: Privy integration for Web3 authentication flows

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Starting implementation of Task 5.1. Initial focus will be on:
1. Setting up EAS contract interactions
2. Implementing the attestation creation flow
3. Integrating with our existing KYC verification system

I notice we already have a foundation in `easService.ts`. Will begin by enhancing this service to handle the full attestation lifecycle.
