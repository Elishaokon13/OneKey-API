description: "Understanding the complete Know Your Customer verification process in OneKey"
---

## Overview

OneKey's KYC (Know Your Customer) flow is designed to provide secure, privacy-preserving identity verification while maintaining compliance with global regulations. The process combines multiple verification methods with client-side encryption to ensure no personal data is stored on our servers.

<Note>
OneKey follows a zero-PII architecture - all sensitive data is encrypted client-side before transmission, ensuring maximum privacy protection.

## Step-by-Step Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Session Creation">
    Create a KYC session specifying user details, document type, and country. OneKey automatically selects the optimal provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Collection">
    User provides identity documents (passport, national ID, driver's license) and optionally takes a selfie for biometric verification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Client-Side Encryption">
    Documents are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before leaving the user's device, ensuring privacy protection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provider Processing">
    Encrypted documents are securely processed by the selected KYC provider for verification checks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification Analysis">
    Multiple verification checks are performed including document authenticity, biometric matching, and liveness detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Results & Attestation">
    Verification results are provided, and optionally, an on-chain attestation can be created for the verified identity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Patterns

### Standard Flow

```javascript
// 1. Create session
const session = await onekey.kyc.createSession({
  user: { id: 'user_123', email: 'user@example.com' },
  documentType: 'passport',
  country: 'US'
});

// 2. Encrypt and upload documents
const encrypted = await onekey.encryption.encrypt({
  data: documentData,
  password: userPassword
});

await onekey.kyc.uploadDocuments(session.id, {
  encryptedData: encrypted.data
});

// 3. Monitor via webhooks
app.post('/webhooks/kyc', (req, res) => {
  const { event, data } = req.body;
  
  if (event === 'kyc.session.completed') {
    // Create attestation for verified users
    if (data.result.status === 'pass') {
      onekey.attestations.create({
        recipient: userWalletAddress,
        kycSessionId: data.sessionId
      });
    }
  }
});
```

### Hosted Flow

```javascript
// Create session with redirect URL
const session = await onekey.kyc.createSession({
  user: userData,
  documentType: 'passport',
  country: 'US',
  redirectUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/kyc/complete'
});

// Redirect user to OneKey's hosted verification
window.location.href = session.verificationUrl;
```

### Mobile Integration

```javascript
// React Native example
import { OneKeyKYC } from '@onekey/react-native-sdk';

const startKYC = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await OneKeyKYC.startVerification({
      apiKey: 'your_api_key',
      user: userData,
      documentType: 'passport',
      country: 'US',
      theme: 'light'
    });
    
    if (result.status === 'completed') {
      console.log('KYC completed:', result.sessionId);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('KYC failed:', error);
  }
};
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

Track key metrics to optimize your KYC flow:

### Success Metrics
- **Completion Rate**: % of sessions that reach completion
- **Pass Rate**: % of completed sessions that pass verification
- **Time to Complete**: Average duration from start to finish
- **User Drop-off**: Where users abandon the process

### Quality Metrics
- **False Positive Rate**: Valid users incorrectly rejected
- **False Negative Rate**: Invalid users incorrectly approved
- **Manual Review Rate**: % requiring human review
- **Provider Performance**: Success rates by provider

### Operational Metrics
- **API Response Times**: Performance monitoring
- **Error Rates**: Technical failure tracking
- **Cost per Verification**: ROI analysis
- **Compliance Audit Success**: Regulatory adherence
